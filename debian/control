Description: Linux Virtual Server support programs
 The Linux Virtual Server (lvs or IPVS) is a highly scalable and highly
 available server built on a cluster of real servers. The architecture of the
 cluster is transparent to end users, and the users see only a single virtual
 server.
 .
 This package provides some support programs necessary to implement a virtual
 server under Linux. With the addition of the mon and heartbeat packages it is
 possible to implement a complete high-availability solution for Linux.
